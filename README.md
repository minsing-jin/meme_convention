# üëæMeme convention

> _"Needed explaining. That humor flopped."_  
>  ‚Äî Shuka World-

This repository is a randomly autocomplete of meme for developers and researchers.
It is designed to make writing more engaging and fun by suggesting memes that are relevant to the content being written.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Motivation
1. Many developer and researcher write in many situations. But I think that their writing is not engaging and fun.
2. In code reviews or issue discussions, plain text can come off as cold‚Äîlike a robot wrote it‚Äîand might accidentally hurt someone's feelings or spark misunderstandings.
3. I believe that memes can help to make writing more engaging and fun, and can also help to clarify(???) the meaning of the text.

I've decided to ditch the dull writing‚Äîtech writing should be fun and easy to read.
In the future, I plan to expand my project into a general platform where anyone can use memes or funny images in the right context.


# üîë Key Features
- When developers write content, the meme convention can autocomplete memes based on contextual rules(It will be automated using recommendation algorithm later), making their writing more engaging and fun.
