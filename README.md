# Meme convention

This repository is a randomly autocomplete of meme for developers and researchers.
It is designed to make writing more engaging and fun by suggesting memes that are relevant to the content being written.

# Motivation
1. Many developer and researcher write in many situations. But I think that their writing is not engaging and fun.
2. In code reviews or issue discussions, plain text can come off as cold—like a robot wrote it—and might accidentally hurt someone's feelings or spark misunderstandings.
3. I believe that memes can help to make writing more engaging and fun, and can also help to clarify(???) the meaning of the text.

I've decided to ditch the dull writing—tech writing should be fun and easy to read.
In the future, I plan to expand my project into a general platform where anyone can use memes or funny images in the right context.

- [ ] Create a meme(I added) convention and autocomplete for developers and researchers when they write something in github situation. (Code review, issue discussion, etc.)
- [ ] Create a meme autocomplete for all developers and researchers when they write something in their code editor.
- [ ] Check people's reaction to the meme convention and autocomplete and decided to whether continue or not.
- [ ] Create a meme autocomplete for all writing long form writing. This step meme can be used in many blogs, articles and other places.
- [ ] Create a meme convention for all people. This step meme can be used in social media, forums and other places.
- [ ] Optimize the meme autocomplete recommendation algorithm to make it more accurate and relevant user-friendly.
